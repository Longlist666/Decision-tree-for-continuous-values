# Decision-tree-from-scratch


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
Decision Tree Algorithm wtitten in Python using NumPy. 

## Overview of the implementaion
The Decision Tree algorithm implemented is using information gain as splitting criteria. The DT can handle categorical and continuous data. Parameters provided to the DT are number of Target labels and the threshold for classifing a feature as categorical, if number of unique values are below him. 

The algorithm is only able to work with natural number classlabels starting by 0.
